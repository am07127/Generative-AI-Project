# 🎯 Bias-Aware Resume Screening System

> **Final Year Project - Generative AI**

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bias-Aware Resume Screening System** is an AI-powered tool designed to mitigate bias in the hiring process. Leveraging **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**, our system evaluates resumes based on skills, experience, and qualifications—reducing the impact of unconscious biases related to gender, ethnicity, or other demographic factors.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Bias Detection & Mitigation**: Identifies biased patterns in job applications and suggests neutral scoring methods.
- 📄 **Resume Parsing & Analysis**: Extracts key information using NLP and ranks candidates fairly.
- 🤖 **Generative AI Insights**: Generates bias-free recommendations for hiring managers.
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: Visual representation of candidate evaluations and fairness metrics.
- 🔒 **Privacy & Security**: Ensures data protection and ethical AI practices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SpaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Frontend**: React.js (for dashboard visualization)
- **Cloud Services**: AWS / Google Cloud (for model deployment)
